# Dumbledore
![](https://travis-ci.org/kosslab-kr/Dumbledore.svg?branch=master)

A Slack Bot called Dumbledore that lets your team join houses and award house points.

## Installation 
* clone this reposity to the machine you want to run the server on.
* If you do not have node `>= 8.0.0` and npm installed on your machine install it
* in the dumbledore directory run:

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running Dumbledore
To run the Dumbledore you must have an [API token](#getting-the-api-token-for-your-slack-channel) to authenticate the bot on your slack channel. Once you get it (instructions on the next paragraph) you just have to run:


```bash
$ BOT_API_KEY={key} BOT_NAME={name} node bin/bot.js
```

## Getting the API token for your Slack channel
To allow the Dumbledore to connect your Slack channel you must provide him an API key. To retrieve it you need to add a new Bot in your Slack organization by visiting the following url: https://*yourorganization*.slack.com/services/new/bot, where *yourorganization* must be substituted with the name of your organization (e.g. https://*dumbledoretest*.slack.com/services/new/bot). Ensure you are logged to your Slack organization in your browser and you have the admin rights to add a new bot.

You will find your API key under the field API Token, copy it in a safe place and get ready to use it.



## Configuration - for development
Dumbledore is configurable through environment variables. There are several variable available:

| Environment variable | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `BOT_API_KEY` | this variable is mandatory and must be used to specify the API token needed by the bot to connect to your Slack organization |
| `BOT_NAME` | the name of your bot, itâ€™s optional and it will default to dumbledore |
| `BOT_GITHUB_CHANNEL_ID` | the channel id for your teams github tracker(optional) |

## Development
* We recommend the nodemon:

```bash
$ npm install -g nodemon
$ cp ./.env_sample ./.env
// You need to change `.env`
$ npm run dev
```

## Test
* We use [jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/):

```bash
$ cp ./.env_sample ./.env
// You need to change `.env`
$ npm test
```



## Configuration - for Production
Dumbledore use [parse-server](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server) for backend.

| Environment variable | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URI` | mongodb connection string |
| `APP_ID` | the application id for backend parse-server |
| `MASTER_KEY` | the masterkey for backend parse-server |
| `PORT` | the external port for web-server |
| `PARSE_EXTERNAL_URL` | the external parse-server url by web-server proxy. ex) https://yourdomain/api/parse |
| `ADMIN_NAME` | the id for signin to dashboard |
| `ADMIN_PASS` | the password for signin to dashboard |

## Production
* Default is `npm start`, but you can also use the pm2:
* Dumbledore needs a mongodb for production.

```bash
$ cp ./.env_sample ./.env
// You need to change `.env`
$ npm start
```

## Making Dumbledore
This bot was based off the work of lmammino and the norrisbot project. I created most of the bot in a few days, but this is still an early version and I recognize the code could be much inproved.
